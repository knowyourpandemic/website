  <p class="mt3">Proper nutrition and hydration are vital. People who eat a well-balanced diet tend to be healthier with stronger immune systems and lower risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases. So you should eat a variety of fresh and unprocessed foods every day to get the vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, protein and antioxidants your body needs.</p>
  <p><b>Disclaimer: There is no proven direct link that says by eating healthy you will not get COVID. Therefore, strict hygiene measures with social distancing must be taken along with a healthy diet and lifestyle.</b></p>
  <p><b>In your diet, you must ensure a balance of:</b></p>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li><b>Calories:</b> Your body needs the energy, so calorie-dense foods are what you need to get your energy levels optimum. Include rice, potatoes, bread, pasta, whole grains and cereals in your diet, but avoid foods with empty calories – like all types of junk food.</li>
    <li><b>Protein:</b> You can’t feel your best without these building blocks of life, so eat more protein-rich foods to get 60-90g of this nutrient every day. Add as many whole grains, lentils, legumes, dairy products, soy products, nuts and seeds as you can in your diet. If you’re non-vegetarian, then have plenty of chicken and eggs as well as fish.</li>
    <li><b>Fruits & Veggies:</b> Fresh fruits and vegetables are great sources of dietary fibre, folate, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Include everything from apples and bananas to gourds and green leafy vegetables in your diet.</li>
    <li class="mb3"><b>Nuts & Seeds:</b> These are a good source of fibre & protein. They are also rich in omega-6 and omega-3 which help in regulating inflammatory responses</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt3">Here are some tips that can help <b>support</b> your body's defence system & keep you healthy:</p>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li>First of all, most importantly; Drink enough <b>WATER</b> every day. Make sure to be sufficiently hydrated with 2-3 liters of water consumed throughout the day. If you drink water because you are thirsty, this means that you are already dehydrated.</li>
    <li><b>NO UNHEALTHY FOOD</b>- Avoid junk foods / Deep fried Packaged food as much as possible.</li>
    <li>Avoid having too much <b>sugar</b> in your diet.</li>
    <li>Eat <b>fresh and unprocessed foods every day</b> - fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat, brown rice or starchy tubers or roots such as potato, yam, taro or cassava), and foods from animal sources (e.g. meat, fish, eggs and milk)</li>
    <li><b>Smart snacking:</b> for snacks, choose raw vegetables and fresh fruit or nuts/seeds rather than foods that are high in sugar, fat or salt.</li>
    <li>Eat moderate amounts of fat and oil - Consume <b>unsaturated fats</b> (e.g. found in fish, avocado, nuts, olive oil, soy, canola, sunflower and corn oils) rather than saturated fats (e.g. found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oils, cream, cheese, ghee and lard).
      <i>Choose white meat (e.g. poultry) and fish, which are generally low in fat, rather than red meat.</i>
      <i>Avoid processed meats because they are high in fat and salt.</i>
      <i>Wherever possible, opt for low-fat or reduced-fat versions of milk and dairy products.</i>
      <i>Avoid industrially produced trans fats. These are often found in processed food, fast food, snack food, fried food, frozen pizza, pies, cookies, margarines and spreads.Trans rate increases the risk of heart disease.</i>
    </li>
    <li>Eat <b>less salt and sugar</b> - When cooking and preparing food, limit the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (e.g. soy sauce and fish sauce). Limit your daily salt intake to less than 5 g (approximately 1 teaspoon), and use iodized salt.
      <i>Avoid foods (e.g. snacks) that are high in salt and sugar.</i>
      <i>Limit your intake of soft drinks or sodas and other drinks that are high in sugar (e.g. fruit juices, fruit juice concentrates and syrups, flavoured milks and yogurt drinks).</i>
      <i>Choose fresh fruits instead of sweet snacks such as cookies, cakes and chocolate.</i>
