    <h2>Are there any home therapies that could help cure COVID?</h2>
    <p><b>NO</b></p>
    <p><b>Note here that traditional and 'home remedies' may provide the affected person some comfort and even alleviate symptoms, BUT there is no evidence that current medication or home remedies could cure or prevent the disease.</b></p>

    <p class="mt2">The decision to administer Remdesivir or any other investigational therapy must be taken by a medical professional and administered only in a hospital setting. <b>Do not attempt to procure or administer Remdesivir at home.</b></p>
    <p><b>Systemic oral steroids not indicated in mild disease.</b> If symptoms persist beyond 7 days (persistent fever, worsening cough etc.) or worsen, consult the treating doctor for further treatment.</p>

    <h2>How about using antibiotics to prevent or treat COVID-19?</h2>
    <p><b>Antibiotics do NOT work against viruses, they only work against bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus. You should NOT use antibiotics as any form of prevention or treatment of COVID-19.</b></p>
    <p>Antibodies will mostly only be prescribed by your doctor if you have a secondary bacterial infection along with the viral infection.</p>
    <p><b>If cough worsens or you feel breathless;</b></p>
    <p><b>EARLY AWAKE SELF-PRONING is advisable.</b></p>
    <p>Prone positioning has been shown to improve oxygenation for decades.</p>
    <p>PRONING is the process of turning a patient with precise, safe motions, from their back onto their abdomen (stomach), so the individual is lying face down.</p>
    <p>Proning is a medically accepted position to improves breathing comfort and oxygenation. It is extremely beneficial in COVID-19 patients with compromised breathing comfort, especially during home isolation.</p>
    <p class="mt2"><b>IMPORTANCE OF PRONING:</b></p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Prone positioning improves ventilation, keeps alveolar units open and breathing easy.</li>
      <li>Missing out on hypoxia (compromised Oxygen circulation) may lead to worsening of complications.</li>
      <li>Timing proning and maintaining good ventilation could save many lives.</li>
    </ul>
