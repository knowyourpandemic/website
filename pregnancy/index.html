    <ul class="disc">
      <li>If you are infected with COVID-19 you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery</li>
      <li>If you develop more severe symptoms or your recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that you are developing a more significant chest infection that requires enhanced care; you should <b>contact your maternity care team immediately.</b></li>
      <li>There may be a need to reduce the number of antenatal visits you have. However, <b>do not reduce your number of visits without agreeing first with your obstetrician.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt1">(Refer to the symptoms section to trace your symptoms.)</p>

    <h2>Can pregnant women get vaccinated against Covid-19?</h2>
    <p>The central government on Friday (25/06/2021) approved COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant &amp; breastfeeding women.</p>
    <p>&quot;The Ministry of Health has issued guidelines that COVID-19 vaccine can be given to pregnant women. The vaccine is
      useful for the pregnant women and it should be given,&quot; said Dr Balram Bhargava, Director-General at Indian Council of
      Medical Research (ICMR).</p>
    <p>World Health Organisation (WHO) had recommended vaccination in pregnant women a few weeks ago, mentioning that the
      benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks.</p>
    <p>The second wave of COVID-19 pandemic hit pregnant and postpartum women more severely compared to the first, with
      significantly higher symptomatic cases and case fatality rate. Hence, vaccination in pregnant &amp; lactating women is strongly
      encouraged. However, please consult your doctor to brief you about what is best for you.</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>The COVID-19 vaccine can be given anytime during the pregnancy.</li>
      <li>All <b>lactating and breastfeeding women</b> are eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccines any time after delivery.</li>
      <li>However, the vaccine must be recieved at the nearest centre &amp; done under the supervision</li>
      <li>You must be well informed about the risks and benefits of the vaccine you recieve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>COVID-19 IN PREGNANCY / LACTATION?</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>BREASTFEEDING AND COVID:</h3>
      <article>
        <h4>Can COVID-19 be passed from a woman to her unborn or new-born baby?</h4>
        <p>Till now, active COVID-19 has <b>not been detected</b> in the breastmilk of any woman with confirmed/suspected COVID-19. So it most likely won't be a problem.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>Should a COVID-19 positive mother discontinue breastfeeding?</h4>
        <p><b>No.</b> There is no evidence yet that mother can transmit the virus through the breast milk.</p>
        <p>A mother is encouraged to continue breastfeeding with certain precautions.</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li>A mother's milk essentially provides the baby with the antibodies or immunity she/he needs. This should not be discontinued as it can be detrimental to the development of the child’s own immunity.</li>
          <li>If the mother isn’t breastfeeding the baby, then she should make sure that she washes her hands properly with soap before touching any utensils etc. being used for preparing the feed. It’s mandatory that all the utensils being used for feed preparation be washed properly before and after the feed.</li>
          <li>Mother should take care to wear a mask at all times, reduce unnecessary contact with the child and wash hands with soap before handling the baby.</li>
        </ul>  
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>What are key messages for a mother who wants to breastfeed but is scared about passing COVID-19 to her infant?</h4>
        <p>As part of counselling, a mother’s or family’s anxiety about COVID-19 should be acknowledged and responded to with the following messages:</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li>Breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact significantly reduce the risk of death in newborns and young infants and provide immediate and lifelong health and development advantages. Breastfeeding also reduces the risk of breast and ovarian cancer for the mother.</li>
          <li>Newborns and infants are at low risk of COVID-19 infection. Among the few cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection in young children, most have experienced only mild or asymptomatic illness.</li>
          <li>The numerous benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with COVID-19.</li>
          <li>Active COVID-19 has not been detected in the breastmilk of any mother with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 and there is no evidence so far that the virus is transmitted through breastfeeding.</li>
          <li>If a mother confirmed/suspected to have COVID-19 was unable to breastfeed because she was too ill or because of another illness, she can start to breastfeed when she feels well enough to do so.
            <ol class="letter">
              <li>There is no fixed time interval to wait after confirmed/suspected COVID-19. There is no evidence that breastfeeding changes the clinical course of COVID-19 in a mother.</li>
              <li>She should be supported in her general health and nutrition to ensure full recovery. She should also be supported to initiate breastfeeding or relactate.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>While handling the baby, the mother should take care to wear a mask at all times, reduce unnecessary contact with the child and wash hands with soap before handling the baby.
          </li>
        </ul>    
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>If a mother is confirmed/suspected to have COVID-19, is infant formula milk safer for infants?</h4>
        <p><b>No.</b> There are always risks associated with giving infant formula milk to newborns and infants in all settings.</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li>The risks associated with giving infant formula milk are increased whenever home and community conditions are compromised. For e.g. reduced access to health services if a baby becomes unwell / reduced access to clean water / access to supplies of infant formula milk are difficult or not guaranteed, not affordable and not sustainable.</li>
          <li>The numerous benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with COVID-19.</li>
          <li>Mother should take care to wear a mask at all times, reduce unnecessary contact with the child and wash hands with soap before handling the baby.</li>

    <h2>Can a COVID-19 positive woman touch and hold her new-born baby?</h2>
    <p><b>No.</b> Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding helps a baby to thrive.</p>
    <p>The mother should be supported to:</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Breastfeed safely, with good respiratory hygiene (wash hands thoroughly & wear mask)</li>
      <li>Hold the newborn skin-to-skin</li>
      <li>Share a room with the baby</li>
      <li>Mother should wash her hands before and after touching the baby, and keep all surfaces clean. She should always wear a mask while handling the baby.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The numerous benefits of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with COVID-19.</p>

    <h2>What to do for mother and newborn if she has recently delivered a baby and mother is found to be COVID 19 positive?</h2>
    <p>If a mother is confirmed/suspected to have COVID-19, there is no recommendation to separate the mother and baby.</p>
    <p>Mother should:</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Wash hands frequently with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand rub, especially before touching the baby.</li>
      <li>Wear a medical mask while feeding. It is important to:
        <ol class="num mt1">
          <li>Replace masks as soon as they become damp</li>
          <li>Dispose off masks immediately</li>
          <li>Not re-use a mask</li>
          <li>Not touch the front of the mask but untie it from behind</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Sneeze or cough into a tissue, immediately dispose of it and use alcohol-based hand rub or wash hands again with soap and clean water</li>
      <li>Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces.</li>
      <li>If the mother has just coughed over her exposed breast or chest, then she should gently wash the breast with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds prior to feeding.
        <i>(It is not necessary to wash the breast before every breastfeed or prior to expressing milk.)</i>
      </li>
