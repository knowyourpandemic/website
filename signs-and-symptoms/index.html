    <h2>How long does it take to develop symptoms?</h2>
    <p>The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. Hence, people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for a minimum of 14 days, to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available.</p>

    <h2>6 Minute Walk Test</h2>
    <p>A 6-minute walk test is an established clinical test to look for cardio pulmonary exercise tolerance. It helps determine how severe is the COVID infection.</p>
    <p>The following are the steps to do the test:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stand with <b>pulse oximeter</b> attached to your finger. Make sure it fits the finger correctly and covers the finger completely. Wait for about <b>30 seconds</b> for the reading to stabilize and check the Oxygen Saturation. (it would normally be >97% in healthy individuals and could be slightly lower i.e.  >94% in people with underlying conditions)</li>
      <li>Then walk in the confines of your own room for 6 minutes.
        <i><b>The time may be cut short for 3 minutes in patients above 60 years of age.</b></i>
      </li>
      <li>Wait for 30 seconds and check the reading on the pulse oximeter again.</li>
      <li>Any drop in saturation <b>below 93%,</b> or an absolute <b>drop of more than 3%,</b> or feeling unwell (light headed, short of breath) while performing the test are significant findings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>If the test is positive that is you observe a significant drop in Saturation, immediately contact your doctor for further guidance. If you're very breathless even after sitting down for some time after the test, go to the nearest hospital/ emergency room as soon as you can.</b></p>
    <p>This test is used to unmask hypoxia.</p>
    <p>(Hypoxia means there is less Oxygen in the blood which supplies to the various organs. Hence of real concern.)</p>
    <p>Patients with positive 6 minute walk test may progress to become hypoxic and hence early intervention in form of admission to hospital, or shifting to ICU and giving oxygen and other appropriate treatment bis recommended.</p>
