    <p class="center">Welcome to the new age, where heading out without a mask can give you the anxiety of a lifetime. At Least, that has been my experience so far. For the first time, a lot of people have started realising the mental impact of external factors. I am no exception to that. I would like to break the impacts into four stages.</p>
    <p class="center">It was late feb 2020, Covid 19 was the new buzz word. I was travelling from Jamshedpur to Mumbai to Bangalore to Kolkata. I had no mask while travelling from Jamshedpur to Mumbai but for the first time I was keeping a note of people coughing around me. Making sure that I stayed as far away as possible. Mind you till now not a single covid case had been reported in the country. It could be because of the news or social media, but it did have some impact on my thought process. Subconsciously I was more alert about a threat. People were under the impression that Indians have lived in such horrible conditions that they would be immune to covid and it would just go off as a simple flu. Nobody imagined how terribly wrong they were going to be. With the intensity of covid increasing across the world every single day, I was now carrying a mask with me for the next journey. Mumbai airport, Bangalore airport or Kolkata airport, all looked the same, deserted. Now I started sensing some fear in the masses which induced fear in me. All my flights were operating at 50-60% occupancy. Was it the fear of covid or was I travelling during a non peak hour, not sure but that made me uneasy. Upon reaching Jamshedpur I had locked myself for 2-3 days, fearing that I might be a carrier or a victim. </p>
    <p class="center">The next segment is when the lockdown was announced. I guess initially people had a good time. A little break from the ordinary. Spending more time at home and having more time to do other things. Personally I was also motivated to do something out of the ordinary. Was it peer pressure or the intent to blend in, can't say but i was also part of the craze. Waking up to ramdev baba’s voice and starting my day with yoga, followed by some skin care, passion to become the next master chef and some meditation. All of those done by morning 9, as hard as it is to believe. Socialization was limited to zoom/meet/team/whatsapp calls and accompanied with sessions of scribble/chess/catan. It was fun till it lasted. Like every high this also plateaued. Which was followed by periods of restlessness to get out of the house. A general sentiment was that every human is trapped like a zoo animal. Lots of social media posts started showing up informing us as to how earth is healing and nature’s way of fighting back. This was also accompanied by the general hatred towards chinese government. </p>

    <p class="center">By now the cases were increasing drastically but slowly everything started to open up and so did the inflow of sad news. A lot of people in my knowledge had either been affected by covid or had lost someone close to covid. Now the threat seemed as real as it can get. That's when the fear and anxiety creeped in. This along with few issues in career and boom, I had a cocktail of anxiety, depression and panic attacks along with episodes of sleepless nights. It didn't feel a lot at first but slowly the cognitive thinking was impaired. It wasn't just me. Everyone in the family could feel that happening. In order to escape this I left for Bangalore before the 2nd wave.</p>
    <p class="center">In this final segment, my main aim was to make me feel good and happy. During this time I went out on a trip, moved into a nice happy apartment, bought everything to make me feel at home and had maintained my distance from everyone I knew. In short I went YOLO. Initially I felt happy living a pre pandemic lifestyle. This didn’t last for more than 2 weeks. The fear of covid still remained. With that being said came the 2nd wave. This time things were different. I was all alone in Bangalore, no friends, no family. This time the situation was different, so was I. This time I didn't jump onto the frenzy train to become the next big thing. This time I worked on myself. Mentally and physically. Not only did I fight the second wave in a better way, I think I came out to be a better person. I did all the household chores along with my work. Not with the intention to get some gratification from social media but for myself and my well being. Working was difficult when I was ill and made me realise the sacrifice a parent makes to raise a child. I regained the feeling of empathy and some level of maturity to balance multiple things at once. Yes, there is still a lot to cover but the first baby steps have been taken.</p>
