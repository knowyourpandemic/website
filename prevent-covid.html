      <h2>Droplet Transmission</h2>
      <p>Respiratory droplets produced when the infected person coughs or sneezes can infect the people (by entering into their mouths, noses, or eyes) who are within 1 meter distance</p>
      <p>
        <b>Surgical mask / Cloth mask</b>
        <i>(if within 1 mt of infected case)</i>
      </p>
      <h2>Contact Transmission</h2>
      <p>Respiratory droplets settles down on floor and surfaces, inanimate objects. Afterwards, when someone touches the floor, surfaces, door handles, inanimate objects etc and then touches their face (nose, mouth, eyes), virus can easily spread</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hand hygiene</b>
        <i>(the most important measure)</i>
      </p>
      <h2>Airborne Transmission</h2>
      <p>Airborne transmission from person-to-person within a range of 1 metre
        <i>Aerosol generating situations: coughing, spitting, singing, vomiting</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>N95 Mask</b></p>

    <article>
      <h2>B) Hand hygiene:</h2>
      <p>We all know by now that COVID-19 is dangerous and is a killer in some cases. But can we possibly kill it first?</p>
      <p>The answer is yes! The weapons to kill COVID-19 are easily accessible, and can be found in our own homes.</p>
      <p>Hand hygiene is very very important for the prevention and control of COVID-19.</p>
      <p>Hand hygiene can be performed with <b>soap and water</b> or <b>alcohol-based hand rubs (&gt;60% alcohol concentration)</b></p>
      <p>Duration: Hand rub 20sec & Hand wash 40sec.</p>
      <p>However, soap and water is considered by far the superior method compared to hand sanitizers.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>Indications for using handrub/sanitizer:</h3>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li>If the hands are not visibly dirty</li>
          <li>Not contaminated with body fluids</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Indications for using hand wash:</h3>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li>Hands are visibly dirty, contaminated with body fluids</li>
          <li>After using restroom</li>
          <li>Before handling medication or food</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>But how does the virus die by washing hands?</h3>
        <p>We can compare SARS-CoV-2 with a piece of chewing gum stuck to our hands. Now, if we try removing the chewing gum with simply water, it would flow over it and the gum would remain attached to our hands.</p>
        <p>The same thing happens with the virus.</p>
        <p>Like gum, a virus is actually very sticky, and likes to stick onto our cells.</p>
        <p>The virus is an invisible chewing gum on our hands. When using soap, it binds with the virus, and breaks the membrane of the virus, killing it in the process. Then, water washes the virus into the drain.</p>
