    <h2>Actions You Can Take</h2>
    <p>The more important thing is to take preventive measures for COVID-19 such as vaccination, wearing a mask , social distancing, and practicing hand hygiene. It is important for people with medical conditions and their providers to work together and manage those conditions carefully and safely. Get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can. If you have a medical condition, the following are actions you can take based on your medical conditions and other risk factors:</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Continue your medicines and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.</li>
      <li>Follow your current treatment plan to keep your medical condition under control.</li>
      <li>Know the triggers for your condition and avoid them when possible (e.g., avoid asthma triggers by having another member of your household clean and disinfect your house for you or avoid possible sickle cell disease triggers to prevent vaso-occlusive episodes or pain crises).</li>
      <li>Learn about stress and coping. You may feel increased stress during this pandemic. Fear and anxiety can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions.</li>
      <li>Do not delay getting emergency care for your medical condition because of COVID-19. Emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care.</li>
      <li>Call your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your medical conditions or if you get sick and think that you may have COVID-19.</li>
      <li>When possible, keep preventive care and other routine healthcare appointments (such as vaccinations and blood pressure checks) with your doctor. Check with your doctor about safety precautions for OPD visits and ask about telemedicine or remote healthcare visit options.</li>
