    <h2>Do you have COVID or is it just COMMON COLD?</h2>
    <p>Influenza or as we commonly call it, Flu and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus, and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.</p>
    <p>Compared to flu, COVID-19 causes more serious illnesses in people. COVID-19 also has a varied time before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Symptoms of flu</h2>
    <p>Flu usually comes on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these symptoms:</p>
    <ul class="disc col2">
      <li>fever or feeling feverish/chills</li>
      <li>cough</li>
      <li>sore throat</li>
      <li>runny or stuffy nose</li>
      <li>muscle or body aches</li>
      <li>headaches</li>
      <li>fatigue (tiredness)</li>
      <li>some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children as compared to adults.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Symptoms of COVID-19</h2>
    <p>People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported â€“ ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms generally appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People can have mild to severe symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:</p>
    <ul class="disc col2">
      <li>Fever or chills</li>
      <li>Cough</li>
      <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
      <li>Headache</li>
      <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
      <li>Sore throat</li>
      <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
      <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
      <li>Diarrhea</li>
    </ul>

    <h2></h2>
    <h2 class="center">SIMILARITIES</h2>
    <h2 class="center">DIFFERENCES</h2>
    <p>Disease causing Virus</p>
    <p>Both are viruses</p>
    <p>Flu - Influenza virus
      <i>Covid-19 - Coronavirus</i>
    </p>
    <p>Time taken for symptoms to appear after exposure/infection</p>
    <p>1 or more days can pass between the person getting infected and for them to  start showing symptoms of the illness</p>
    <p>If a person has COVID-19, it could take them longer to experience symptoms than if they had flu
      <i>A person experiences symptoms 1 to 4 days after infection in Flu.</i>
    </p>
    <p>For how long can someone spread the Virus?</p>
    <p>For both COVID-19 and flu, there can be spread of the virus for at least 1 day before experiencing any symptoms.</p>
    <p>If a person has COVID-19, they could be contagious for a longer time than if they had flu, almost up to 10 - 14 days from the time of infection.
      <i>People who are hospitalized with severe disease and people with weakened immune systems can be contagious for 20 days or longer.</i>
      <i>People with flu can be contagious from the 3rd to 7th day generally.</i>
    </p>
    <p>How the virus spreads</p>
    <p>Both COVID-19 and flu can spread from person-to-person between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Both are spread mainly by large and small particles containing virus that are expelled when people with the illness (COVID-19 or flu) cough, sneeze, or talk.
      <i>In indoor settings with poor ventilation, small particles might be spread further than 6 feet and cause infections.</i>
      <i>Infection is also possible if a person touches a surface that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes.</i>
    </p>
    <p>COVID-19 is more contagious than flu viruses.
      <i>Also, COVID-19 has been observed to have higher superspreading events than flu.</i>
      <i>This means the virus that causes COVID-19 can very easily spread to a lot of people.</i>
    </p>
    <p>High Risk Category</p>
    <p>Older adults
      <i>People with certain underlying medical conditions (including infants and children)</i>
      <i>During Pregnancy</i>
    </p>
    <p>COVID-19 seems to cause more serious illnesses in some people.</p>
    <p>Complications</p>
    <p>Pneumonia
      <i>Respiratory failure</i>
      <i>Acute respiratory distress syndrome</i>
      <i>Sepsis</i>
      <i>Shock</i>
      <i>Worsening of chronic medical conditions (involving the lungs, heart, or nervous system or diabetes)</i>
      <i>Inflammation of the heart, brain, or muscle tissues</i>
      <i>Secondary infections (bacterial or fungal infections that can occur in people who have already been infected with flu or COVID-19)</i>
    </p>
    <p>Most people who get flu will recover on their own in a few days to two weeks, with only a few going into severe complications.
      <i>Whereas chances of secondary infections are higher in Covid-19 than in flu;</i>
      <i>Additional complications of Covid include: blood clots in veins and arteries, multisystem inflammatory disorders in children and adults.</i>
    </p>
    <p>Mortality ratio</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>COVID-19 has higher mortality than Flu but that is subject to various underlying conditions and external factors</p>
    <p>Vaccine</p>
    <p>Available for both</p>
    <p>Multiple vaccines for flu whereas for Covid-19 few have been authorised and others are under development</p>
    <p>Seasonal variation</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Flu however has been proved to be linked to seasonal variation more due to allergic conditions. For COVID-19 it is yet to be established.</p>
