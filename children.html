  <p class="mt3">Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, can get sick from COVID-19, and can spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to others. Children, like adults, who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms (“asymptomatic”) can still spread the virus to others.</p>
  <p>Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all. However, some children can get severely ill from COVID-19.</p>
  <p>Babies under 1 year old might be more likely to have severe illness from COVID-19. Other children, regardless of age, with the following underlying medical conditions might also be at increased risk of severe illness compared to other children:</p>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li>Asthma or chronic lung disease</li>
    <li>Diabetes</li>
    <li>Genetic, neurologic, or metabolic conditions</li>
    <li>Sickle cell disease</li>
    <li>Heart disease since birth</li>
    <li>Immunosuppression (weakened immune system due to certain medical conditions or being on medications that weaken the immune system)</li>
    <li>Medical complexity (children with multiple chronic conditions that affect many parts of the body, or are dependent on technology and other significant supports for daily life)</li>
    <li>Obesity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in adults and children and can look like symptoms of other common illnesses such as colds, strep throat, or allergies. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough, but children may have any of these signs or symptoms of COVID-19:</p>
  <ul class="disc col2_900">
    <li>Fever or chills</li>
    <li>Cough</li>
    <li>Nasal congestion or runny nose</li>
    <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
    <li>Sore throat</li>
    <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
    <li>Diarrhea</li>
    <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
    <li>Stomachache</li>
    <li>Tiredness</li>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
    <li>Excessive irritability or crying</li>
    <li>Poor appetite or poor feeding, especially in babies under 1 year old</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>MIS-C and COVID-19</h2>
    <p>Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious condition that appears to be linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most children who become infected with the COVID-19 virus have only a mild illness. But in children who go on to develop MIS-C, some organs and tissues — such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin or eyes — become severely inflamed. Signs and symptoms depend on which areas of the body are affected.</p>
    <p>Signs and symptoms of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) include those below, though not all children have the same symptoms.</p>
    <ul class="disc col2_900">
      <li>Fever that lasts 24 hours or longer</li>
      <li>Vomiting</li>
      <li>Diarrhea</li>
      <li>Pain in the stomach</li>
      <li>Skin rash</li>
      <li>Feeling unusually tired</li>
      <li>Fast heartbeat</li>
      <li>Rapid breathing</li>
      <li>Red eyes</li>
      <li>Redness or swelling of the lips and tongue</li>
      <li>Redness or swelling of the hands or feet</li>
      <li>Headache, dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
      <li>Enlarged lymph nodes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Emergency warning signs of MIS-C</h2>
    <ul class="disc col2_900">
      <li>Severe stomach pain</li>
      <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
      <li>New confusion</li>
      <li>Pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds—depending on skin tone</li>
      <li>Inability to wake up or stay awake</li>

    <h2>Can adolescents catch COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>Yes. All age groups can catch COVID-19.</p>
    <p>While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, so far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years have few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of critical illness have been reported.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Can adolescents spread COVID-19 to other people even if they have mild or no symptoms?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Infected people in all age groups – including adolescents - can transmit the virus to other people, even if they have mild symptoms or do not feel ill.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Routine Immunisations during COVID</h2>
    <p>WHO recommends that countries continue routine immunization services wherever feasible. For example, school-based vaccination initiatives should continue only if infection prevention and control measures are implemented to avoid increased risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus among the students, school personnel and health care providers.</p>
    <p>For example, the HPV vaccine that requires two doses can be started anytime between 9 and 14 years of age and the interval between the two doses can be longer. It is most important that you receive the second dose at some point in time to be fully protected.</p>
    <p>Other vaccinations, if to be taken the same day, have to be taken on a different site than the one for the Covid vaccination.</p>
    <p>If a person gets bitten by a dog or any other animal and has to take a rabies vaccine, can take it even if he or she has only taken the first dose of the covid vaccination, has not taken the covid vaccine or has taken both the doses.This is because Rabies is a life threatening condition and a person if infected will show higher chances of mortality as compared to COVID-19. The specific cases however need to be consulted with a doctor for the timing and intervals between the covid vaccine doses and rabies vaccine.</p>
