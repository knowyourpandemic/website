  <p class="mt3">Your immune system defends & protects you against disease-causing microorganisms. But sometimes it fails: A germ invades successfully and makes you sick.</p>
  <p>There are so many products available in the market claiming to boost your immunity. But it doesn't really make sense scientifically.</p>
  <p>In fact, boosting the number of cells in your body — immune cells or others — is not necessarily a good thing. For example, athletes who engage in "blood doping" — pumping blood into their systems to boost their number of blood cells and enhance their performance — run the risk of strokes/ heart attacks.</p>
  <p>Attempting to boost the cells of your immune system is very complicated as there are so many different kinds of cells in the immune system that respond to so many different organisms in so many different ways. Which cells should you boost, and how much to boost?</p>
  <p>No one knows! What is known is that the body is continually generating immune cells. No one knows how many cells or what is the best type and number of cells in the immune system  that are needed to function at its optimum level.</p>
  <p><b>Disclaimer: Keep in mind that you cannot “boost” your immune system by taking a pill or formulation and that no specific food, “superfood” or supplement will prevent you from being infected with COVID-19.</b></p>

    <h2>How does the immune system work?</h2>

    <p>Older people & people with other health conditions have lesser immune cells to fight off a new infection. Stress can also lead to lesser immune function.</p>
    <p>The immune system is — a system, not a single entity. To function well, it requires balance and harmony. So what we can do is <b>support</b> our immune system & not let it deteriorate.</p>
    <p>Healthy ways to support your immune system & help it produce immune cells efficiently :</p>
    <ul class="disc col2_1250">
      <li>Don't <b>smoke</b>.</li>
      <li>Eat a <b>diet</b> high in fruits and vegetables.</li>
      <li><b>Exercise</b> regularly.</li>
      <li>Maintain a <b>healthy weight</b>.</li>
      <li>If you drink <b>alcohol</b>, drink only in moderation.</li>
      <li>Get adequate <b>sleep</b>.</li>
      <li>Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and practicing other <b>preventive measures</b>.</li>
      <li>Try to minimize <b>stress</b>.</li>
      <li>Keep current with all recommended vaccines. <b>Vaccines</b> help your immune system to fight off infections before they take hold in your body.</li>
