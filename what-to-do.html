    <h2>Should I get tested for COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>If you have had contact with an established covid positive case in the last two weeks and are showing symptoms such as body ache, fever, chills, myalgia, cough, sore throat, loss of smell and taste, runny nose, difficulty in breathing, etc. then one should get tested at the earliest.</p>
    <p><b>The gold standard for detecting COVID-19 remains the RT-PCR test.</b></p>
    <p>One can also go for a <b>Rapid Antigen Test or RAT</b>, which gives quick results.</p>
    <p>(<b>Important to note!</b></p>
    <p>An antibody test is not performed to check for the virus, but rather to see whether our immune system has responded to the infection. Additionally, current antibody tests do not tell us if we are in fact immune to COVID-19. This is because we don't know how long these antibodies protect us from the virus )</p>
    <p>CT Scan for detection of COVID-19 is not advisable as it only detects COVID-19 pneumonia and mild cases may be missed.</p>
    <p><b>False negative reports</b> have become more prevalent as the virus mutates.</p>
    <p>If you have typical COVID-19 symptoms but test RT-PCR negative, consider yourself as having a COVID infection and treat accordingly (due to the false negative possibility)</p>
    <p>Speak to your doctor.</p>
    <p>Home testing is also offered, but only via private labs as of now and carries extra charge. Alternatively, one can go to the nearest govt. testing centre and get tested free of cost.</p>
    <p>Don't be afraid to go to the hospital; hospitals are safe places for care. Protective measures are in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
    <p>If you have come in contact with someone who later tested positive, isolate yourself for 7 days and watch for symptoms.</p>
    <p>If you show symptoms, immediately get tested/ speak to your doctor.</p>

    <h2>When should I get a test for COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local healthcare providers and follow their guidance.</p>
    <p><b>While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. </b></p>
