  <p class="mt3">Hey! How are you!</p>
  <p>I know it's difficult. Maybe you're just hanging in there. We are not fine now, none of us are fine. We are all sharing a crisis.</p>
  <p>The crisis of a virus initially the COVID-19 virus, but also everything that it's changing about our world, from the economy, the way we're going to interact with each other, to everything. It's a scary time and we all feel anxious.</p>
  <p>You know, physical health and mental health are similar. Just like people invest & work on their physical body by working out, exercising with determination; we even have to work on our mental health.</p>
  <p>How can we do that?</p>
  <p>Here are some solutions to the problems we face:</p>
  <article>
    <h2>1) Make good use of this opportunity : TIME!</h2>
    <p>Think of all the things you wanted to do in your free time- related to learning or discovering or exploring or researching something eg: Drawing, Painting, Meditation, chess, cooking, learning a sport, learning an instrument.</p>
    <p>This time now in your hands, you can work towards your goal, constructively.</p>
    <p>You can create the life you want. This is an opportunity to grow.</p>
    <p>You can work on your own personal growth, explore your interests, build your relationships.</p>
    <p>Write down what you want to achieve during this lockdown & your time at home.</p>
    <p>Accomplish something during this time: listen to informative podcasts, read new books, do online free courses( on COURSERA, EdX, UDACITY, CANVAS ) or learn new things on YouTube, listen to audio books, etc.</p>
    <p>Take control of your time!</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>2) Coping with boredom... What to do?</h2>
    <p>You have to take the initiative and work on what you want to do actively because otherwise we tend to waste the entire day.</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li class="mt1">The things that you didn't always have the time for but really want to do, you can do them now.</li>
      <li>You can also lean towards self care & relaxation like doing a spa day at home, or playing games with your siblings and family, calling someone you normally wouldn't have the time to talk with, watching your favourite online shows/ movies, doing exercises/ learning dance;</li>
      <li>Or home work like organizing your closet, or changing the interiors of your home, going to your junk email going through your old WhatsApp messages;</li>
      <li>Or learning something new like a new art, or learning a new language.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt1">Make a list & start writing down all that you want to do. Lazy? Find a partner to do things together, maybe workout with your friend at the same time at different places. Follow up with them daily.</p>
    <p>Create healthy distractions, choose the distractions that will help you in long term.</p>
    <p>But again there shouldn't be any pressure to do things exactly like others suggest. There are no rules of what you should do and what you shouldn’t. If you feel the need to you can but if you also feel like relaxing or doing something else then you should.</p>
    <p>Give yourself a break and don't be too hard on yourself.</p>
    <p>If you feel like withdrawing from people, having some time alone that is not wrong too. Give others some space too. Know that it's okay.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>3) Create a vision for your future:</h2>
    <p>Create a plan for your future writing all your goals down.</p>
    <p>It definitely is difficult during a crisis to make goal and fix the target and keep going on your routine.</p>
    <p>Make goals that will be the most impactful in your life and set a time limit for it.</p>
    <p>So make a <b>daily routine</b> by incorporating tasks to help you slowly move in the direction of your big goal. Create a <b>designated place for you to work at home.</b></p>
    <p>Your brain loves habits. So focus on creating good habits, a good schedule and slowly removing the bad habits.</p>
    <p>Because if you do not create a schedule your brain is going to focus on unhealthy habits leading to laziness, procrastination and an unhealthy life.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>4) Coping with Grief:</h2>
    <p>Either the news that you have been tested as COVID positive or the loss of a loved one; grief plays a huge role in our overall mental health.</p>
    <p>Develop mindfulness, be aware of the present moment, know and understand what you're going through.</p>
    <p>Going through the stages of grief is a very natural thing to happen; do not be stressed do not worry. You are not crazy or ill to feel this.</p>
    <p>The 5 stages of grief: ( the Kübler-Ross model )</p>
    <ol class="mt1">
      <li><b>Shock/ Denial</b> - you may get anxious, stressed, numb. You may feel pain and guilt. Keep thinking about the future and how it's going to be alright.</li>
      <li><b>Anger</b> - This is an immediate emotional reaction. Don't judge yourself or others, it's going to be okay.</li>
      <li><b>Bargaining</b> - This gives the sense of helplessness which can be alarming to our mind. Understand that this is normal, but that this may detach you from the reality of the situation.</li>
      <li><b>Depression/ sadness/ loneliness</b> - This is a feeling of loss of control in that situation. Refocus yourself on some of the positive things at that moment.</li>
      <li><b>Acceptance</b> - This is a feeling of stability. Here is where the power lies.</li>
    </ol>
    <img class="full-img mt3 max_30" src="media/img/mental_health1.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="mt2">Just remember that this too shall pass!</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>5) Coping with Stress:</h2>
    <p>Remember that stress is cumulative , it is the total sum of all the little stressors in all the aspects of your life, may it be work, friends, family, your environment, your home, your own mind and body and everything else.</p>
    <p>You must realise what your feeling and accept it. Blaming yourself for those emotions or overthinking about them will only lead to more stress.</p>
    <p><b>Be a social creature in isolation.</b></p>
    <p>Reach out to people if you feel the need, talk to you friends and family. REMEMBER, NOT SOCIAL DISTANCING BUT PHYSICAL DISTANCING IS IMPORTANT!</p>
    <p>So what can you do about it?</p>
    <p>The goal is to make a conscious decision in creating positivity around you and decreasing the negative factors.</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="mt1"><b>PREVENT IT</b> : by practicing self care, doing things that bring you joy and excitement.</li>
      <li><b>PROCESSING & LETTING IT OUT</b> : unhealthy ways of expressing emotions are reacting & blaming yourself for thinking about the situations that lead to stress, however a few healthy ways of expressing your emotions and addressing the situation are- writing what YOU FEEL ABOUT THE SITUATION (not the situation itself) in a journal , or talking to someone you trust, sitting a while in silence, listening to music, crying out if need be to release the emotions, or talking to someone who is going through the same thing.</li>
      <li><b>RECOVERY</b> : Exercising really helps reduce the level of stress. Exercise releases ENDORPHINS that interact with the receptors in your brain that reduce your perception of pain. It also triggers a positive feeling in the body. Learning new skills helps keep your mind engaged on positive things which will ultimately help you in growing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt1"><b>Meditation</b> really helps with calming the mind & giving you the sense of control.</p>
    <p>( Refer to the techniques mentioned under the heading 'anxiety' )</p>
    <p>Know your circle of control know what things are really in your control and learn to let go of the things that you cannot control. This gives you a lot more practical decisions that you can take to help you and the people around you, also benefitting your mental health.</p>
    <p>We need to direct our focus on things we CAN control—things within our “circle of control”.</p>

    <a class="img-cred" href="https://latchana.co.uk/agile/circles/">Infographic created by latchana - www.latchana.co.uk</a>
    <p class="mt2">There are 3 levels of influence:</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Things that you can directly control</li>
      <li>Things you can influence a little</li>
      <li>Things that you have no control and influence over</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=mt2>So let us look at those things:</p>
    <ol class="num">
      <li>Things that are in your control -</li>
      <ul class="disc">
        <li>How much effort you put into something</li>
        <li>How many times you smile, say “thank you”, or show appreciation today</li>
        <li>How well you prepare for something</li>
        <li>How you react to an emotion (yes, you have a choice)</li>
        <li>What you focus on</li>
        <li>How you interpret a situation</li>
        <li>What you commit to doing or not doing</li>
        <li>What conversations you have and what you engage in</li>
        <li>How much you focus on the present moment</li>
        <li>What you tell yourself and how nice you are to YOU</li>
        <li>How you take care of your body</li>
        <li>How many new things you are exposed to</li>
        <li>What you do in your free time</li>
        <li>What information you consume: books you read, media you listen to or watch</li>
        <li>When you ask for help</li>
        <li>Whether you make plans and act on them</li>
        <li>How much you believe what other people say</li>
        <li>How long it takes you to try again when you fail</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt1">Notice that all of these things are DIRECTLY related to YOU. Yes, YOU, your actions, thoughts, emotions, beliefs and choices are what are within your circle of control.</p>
      <li>Things you have a little influence / no influence on -</li>
      <p>Outside of your circle of control, the next level is your sphere of influence. Feeling that we influence others gives us a sense of purpose, meaning, and control which gives us happiness. Notice that influence is different than control. There are two ways that you can increase your level of happiness when it comes to our influence:</p>
      <ul class="disc">
        <li><b>Increase your influence on others around you.</b> The type of influence we’re talking about here is being a leader in our inner circle—meaning leading by example. For example, when we follow our dreams, stand up for what we believe, and when we grow, we empower other around us to do the same thing. It is about living in the reality that if you change your behavior, or attitude, other people tend to notice and are affected by those changes whether they want to or not.</li>
        <li><b>Increasing your awareness of how you currently influence those around you.</b> When you acknowledge the positive impact you are having on others, it boosts your confidence. Influence is a normal part of human nature. It’s up to you to decide in what ways you are influenced by others and whether you are a good influence on those around you.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>6) Fear/ worry?</h2>
    <p>Sometimes your thoughts are directly related to what's currently happening, but most of the time your mind is thinking of something else. In a time of crisis or a challenging event, it can be really easy to get carried away and be fearful. You must understand the difference and we are able to distinguish between the two types:</p>
    <ol class="letter">
      <li>BIOLOGICAL FEAR - fear as a reaction to what is currently happening in the present, something that you are facing first hand.</li>
      <li>PSYCHOLOGICAL FEAR - fear you are experiencing because of an idea or expectation of the future, worrying about what will happen or what can happen. Fear for your relatives or about the world in general and that you're not able to help in any way & are overwhelmed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt1">First, identify what you're feeling. Know that by you worrying nothing is going to change the current situation. It never does. It doesn't help the society, doesn't help you're family, doesn't help you! It only puts you in a damaging negative state of mind which will inturn lead to further damage to your overall health.</p>
    <p>So you can make an active decision to not Live in fear & to take back control of your emotions. Once you decided, then you can use the following to keep you on track:</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li><b>OBSERVING YOUR THOUGHTS:</b> You cannot stop your thoughts, but you can get better in managing and directing them. Pay attention to them as they come in your mind.
        <ol class="letter">
          <li>Notice the thought - what am I thinking now? Maybe even write it down.</li>
          <li>Identify it - is it positive or negative.</li>
          <li>Let it go - if it is a negative thought, let it go. Do not engage in it else it will lead you down the train of negative thoughts.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>CHANGING YOUR THOUGHT:</b> If you're already caught up in the downward spiral of negative thoughts or when you notice that you are fearful; engage in HEALTHY DISTRACTIONS so that your mind jumps from a negative thought to a beneficial one. Your emotions are a result of your thoughts at the present moment. Shift your focus to something else, something productive. Keep thinking of that healthy distraction very intensely as and when you keep going back to the negative thought.
        <i>Keep in mind that our behaviour is just a function of our decisions that we take, not the situation we are in. Eg- the whole world can be falling apart in front of us but we can still control how we perceive things, our emotions and what we decide to do within our inner self.</i>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Avoiding conflict : ANGER?</h2>
    <p>During a stressful time it is easy to get in a conflict with your loved ones; at home or with friends.</p>
    <p>Notice when you get irritable and express it correctly. Don't let your brain trick you. Do not take things others say personally too. It's a result of the stress they are facing. Just tell the person that you are a little stressed, so that they give you the space and understand. When we get emotional our prefrontal cortex shuts down and our amygdala ( the emotional centre) takes over which is stronger than our prefrontal cortex; thus releasing hormones. Hence our emotions take control of our actions.</p>
    <ol class="letter">
      <li>recognise what you are feeling</li>
      <li>take a moment and focus on your breath ( helps stimulate the prefrontal lobe)</li>
      <li>take a walk/ exercise</li>
      <li>take a break - a long bath / watch your favourite show</li>
    </ol>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>8) Anxious/ Restless?</h2>
    <p>When posed a threat, our body automatically goes into a 'fight or flight response' mode. So with all the Adrenaline, it's only natural to feel like you're heart is beating faster or your mouth is dry or you're over energized; all signs of anxiousness/ restlessness. Due to COVID, we are all facing a chronic stressor. Therefore, we may notice certain changes in our daily life : sleep, emotional control, health.</p>
    <p>With practice you'll be able to control your anxiety.</p>
    <p>You can't immediately jump from anxiety to relaxation. Trying to tell yourself to not be anxious can make you more anxious. So what can you do?</p>
    <ol class="num">
      <li>Distraction : Healthy distractions</li>
      <li>Make a routine and stick to it : Wake up and sleep at the same time everyday, eat HEALTHY MEALS at a fixed time, schedule your weekdays like how they were before the lockdown</li>
      <li>Passive : putting on meditation music / relaxing music</li>
      <li>Active/ mindful : <b>MEDITATION / GUIDED RELAXATION</b> - it may take just a few minutes, but when we incorporate meditation in our routine, it has immense ability to restore inner peace and tranquillity in the long run.</li>
    </ol>

You can also learn how to dance which is a wonderful form of exercise.</p>
    <p>Whatever it is you can write it down and commit to it. Make a commitment to yourself.</p>

      <h3>THINGS TO AVOID:</h3>
      <ol class="num">
        <li>Obsessing over the NEWS - News addiction can be the cause of your constant anxiety & stress.
          <i>(What to do instead : keep 2-3 hours max per day to catch up on the news if you really need to but the rest of the time refraining from it. Stay informed, not overloaded.</i>
          <i>Avoid watching news 2 hours before going to bed.</i>
          <i>After watching the news do a healthy distraction every single day like - watching your favourite movies or a cricket match or watching a comedy series/ listening to music or singing or dancing/ meditation or yoga or exercise/ socially connect with people via video call or phone keeping in mind PHYSICAL DISTANCING).</i>
        </li>

    <h2>IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY</h2>
    <p>It is natural to build up stress, sadness, anxiety, and constant worry during and after a major pandemic. All people handle these situations differently, and there is no perfect way of going about it. The key is to accept your worries, and take charge of self-care, or even seek out for help. Taking care of your mental health during a pandemic helps you maintain peace, and allows you to focus on yourself, your family, and loved ones. Most importantly, be patient with yourself. Self care is tender; it is sacred ground. There is no greater investment, and it helps you in your long-term healing.</p>

    <h2>POST COVID SYNDROME?</h2>
    <p>What are the long term effects of covid-19 psychologically?</p>
    <section>
      <h3>What is normal?</h3>
      <p>A study said that people who turn positive could develop a new mental health illness within 90 days of diagnosis.</p>
      <p>22% Patients admitted to the hospital and 38% patients admitted to the ICU have shown to develop anxiety or depression.</p>
      <p>Other symptoms may include : confusion, insomnia, decreased memory retention, poor concentration, anxiety, low mood, depression, post-traumatic stress (PTSD) these are normal reactions to being critically ill.</p>
      <p>In currently positive patients/ recently treated patients, the most commonly affected factor is :</p>
      <p><b>Mood</b> - Patients who are restricted and alone when sick/ following a long stay in hospital may develop various symptoms of mental instability. It is important to accept that it will take time to recover physically and psychologically.</p>
      <p>It can be useful to set small realistic goals to help you see your progress and feel better in yourself. You may find keeping a diary helps with this process and remember to be patient with yourself and your recovery, as it may take some time.</p>
      <p>It is important to speak with those you are close to but if the feelings continue, please speak to your doctor who will advise you on what to do next. You can also refer yourself for psychological support.</p>
      <p>Remember this is a process, it does not have to be perfect but you have to consistently keep trying because we are looking forward to grow and benefit ourselves and the people around us.</p>
      <p>Ask yourself,</p>
      <ol class="num">
        <li>WHO DO I WANT TO BECOME AFTER ALL THIS?</li>
        <li>WHERE DO I WANT TO REACH AFTER THIS GETS OVER?</li>
        <li>WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET THERE?</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mt1">Incase all of this is just too overwhelming to handle on your own don't be afraid to consult a psychiatrist.</p>
      <p>If you are not comfortable talking to a psychiatrist, feel free to email us, if you need someone to talk to or share what you're going through or need any help.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Contributors to mental health issues:</h3>
      <ol class="num">
        <li>physical exhaustion- after doing the covid duty (dehydration and weight loss)</li>
        <li>physical separation-  when you are isolated from your family staying alone working</li>
        <li>constant fever being infected while working in the covid ward or hospital. Constantly having to check the mask, whether the PPE KIT has been worn properly checking for leaks.</li>
        <li>the lack of resources- nrhm masks/ remdesevir injections/ other medications availability/ checking for bed availability in the ICU ( you want to shift the patient but there are no beds available in the ICU what's the health worker in a dilemma as what to do and what not to do)</li>
        <li>Seeing critically ill patients- when they are gasping for air or when you are helpless because of in availability of resources</li>
        <li>Passing away of patients- inevitable circumstances seeing the death of your patients who you have cared for all this time. Being with your patients in their last moments. Being strong emotionally and trying to calm the family members.</li>
        <li>Triage- deciding which patient is critical and which patient has to be admitted.</li>
        <li>The fear of patients relatives abusing you threatening you can be traumatizing. This is where you need help but you are unable to get help.</li>
        <li>Moral injury - is when healthcare providers are repeatedly expected to go against their morals and choose one over the other (eg: when there is only one bed available in the ICU and you have two patients to shift, but can move either one, you are faced with a moral injury.)
          <i>Moral injury can occur when someone engages in, fails to prevent, or witnesses acts that conflict with their values or beliefs.</i>
          <i>Examples of events that may lead to moral injury include:</i>
          <ul class="disc">
            <li>Having to make decisions that affect the survival of others or where all options will lead to a negative outcome</li>
            <li>Doing something that goes against your beliefs (referred to as an act of commission)</li>
            <li>Failing to do something in line with your beliefs (referred to as an act of omission)</li>
            <li>Witnessing or learning about such an act</li>
            <li>Experiencing betrayal by trusted others</li>
          </ul>
          <i>Such potentially morally injurious experiences may lead to feelings of moral distress such as guilt, shame, and anger. Moral injury is the lasting psychological, spiritual, behavioral or social impact that may result from these experiences.</i>
          <i>This may lead to COMPASSION FATIGUE.</i>
          <i>All this can lead to DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, DECREASED ENERGY LEVELS, ANXIETY, FEAR, PANIC, NIGHTMARES, GUILT, OVERTHINKING.</i>

      <h3>What could you do?</h3>
      <ol class="num">
        <li>Get proper 6-8 hours of sleep and do some meditation in the day.</li>
        <li>Follow good & healthy eating habits</li>
        <li>If in a difficult situation during triage or on duty, seek help from your colleagues/ friends</li>
        <li>Learn the skills and knowledge that would be required of you in the place where you've been posted. Be prepared. This will increase your confidence.</li>
        <li>You can share your experiences by talking to your coworkers, or one of your friend who is a medico. This will help alleviate the situation.</li>
        <li>Learn to let go. Separate your work life and your personal life. Don't carry the burden of every person you meet and every single patient.</li>
        <li>Don't feel guilty you are not responsible for the lack of medications or hospital beds. Do not blame yourself. Give your best when on duty and bring the shortcomings to the notice of the authorities.</li>
        <li>Keep a check on your family's needs.</li>
        <li>Remember that despite all the bad outcomes, there are so many more patients who are recovering every single day and going back home happily. So feel proud and happy.</li>
        <li>A suggestion to maintain a gratitude journal and write in it every time before sleeping at least one thing that happened good today. Eg: a patient healed that day, a relative smiling and saying thank you or a patient recovering because of your intervention or an ICU patient shifted to the ward.</li>
