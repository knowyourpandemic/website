    <h2>What is a virus?</h2>
    <p>A virus is a microorganism that is smaller than a bacteria and can not grow or reproduce independently. A virus invades living cells and uses its chemical machinery to keep itself alive and replicate.</p>

    <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (named on 7th January 2020 by WHO as SARS-CoV-2 and then on 11th February 2020 as COVID 19).</p>
    <p>SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS group of viruses, others being SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</p>
    <p>Coronaviruses are not new viruses as some may think. They have been around mainly as animal infecting viruses.The spikes on the surface of coronaviruses give this virus family its name-corona, which is Latin for crown. Most coronaviruses have been circulating among humans for a very long time and are typically benign. Yet, occasionally, coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, causing the disease COVID-19, circulate in an animal reservoir, and mutate just enough to reach a stage where they start infecting and causing disease in humans. In the case of COVID-19, researchers detected the coronavirus among bats. They believe the virus eventually mutated and it is now causing disease in humans.</p>

    <h2>Why is it called COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>COVID-19 stands for Coronavirus disease of 2019 as it is caused by the Coronavirus and was first reported in 2019.</p>
    <p>This was first reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.</p>

    <h2>How does the virus spread?</h2>
    <ol class="num">
      <li>person to person contact (droplets/aerosols)</li>
      <li>touching eyes, mouth, nose with infected hands</li>
      <li>fomites
        <ul class="disc">
          <li class="mt1">Individuals are at high risk of contracting the virus when a person is in close contact (within 6 feet) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing or sneezing). It is thus recommended to always maintain at least a distance of about 2 arms' length from someone who is sick.</li>
          <li>The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. The particles can be larger respiratory droplets or small aerosols.</li>
          <li>A person might be infected when aerosols/droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>
          <li>The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor areas, where people tend to spend more time. This is because aerosols remain suspended in air or travel more than 1 metre (long-range).</li>
          <li>People might also be infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated by the virus and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.</li>
          <li>The virus infects healthy individuals & causes more problems in those sick.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>When is the virus transmitted by infected people?</h2>
    <p>Regardless of their symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people.</p>
    <p>Data suggests that infected people appear to be most infectious just before they develop symptoms (that is 2 days before they develop symptoms) and in the initial period of the illness. People who develop severe disease can be infectious for longer.</p>
    <p>While someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to others, it is still not clear how frequently this occurs and more research is needed in this area.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>What are fomites?</h2>
    <p>Respiratory secretions or droplets expelled by infected individuals can contaminate surfaces and objects, creating fomites (contaminated surfaces).</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Fomite-mediated transmission</h3>
      <p>The risk of fomite-mediated transmission is dependent on:</p>
      <ul class="disc">
        <li>The infection prevalence rate in the community</li>
        <li>The amount of virus infected people expel (which can be substantially reduced by wearing masks)</li>
        <li>The deposition of expelled virus particles onto surfaces (fomites), which is affected by air flow and ventilation</li>
        <li>The interaction with environmental factors (like heat and/or evaporation) which cause damage to virus particles that are airborne and on fomites</li>
        <li>The time between when a surface becomes contaminated and when a person touches the surface</li>
        <li>The efficiency of transference of virus particles from fomite surfaces to hands and from hands on to the face (nose, mouth, eyes) that have mucous membranes.</li>
        <li>The dose of virus needed to cause infection through the mucous membrane route</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As many factors affect the efficiency of environmental transmission, the relative risk of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is considered low compared with direct contact, droplet or airborne transmission.</p>
      <p>Both cleaning (use of soap or detergent) and disinfection (use of a product or process designed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2) can decrease the risk of fomite transmission. Cleaning reduces the amount of soil (e.g., dirt, microbes and other organic agents, and chemicals) on surfaces, but it’s efficacy varies by the type of cleaner used, the cleaning procedure, and how well the cleaning has been done.</p>

    <h2>COVID-19 and pets</h2>
    <p>A small number of pets including mostly cats and dogs have been reported to be infected by the virus, specially those in close contact with COVID patients.</p>
    <p>However, based on the information available, the risk of spread to humans from pets is considerably low.</p>
    <p>Even so, if you have pets, treat them as you would any family member, isolate and quarantine and consult your veterinarian.</p>

    <h2>Variants of the virus</h2>
    <p>Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus have a high probability of occurring over time. A variant has one or more mutations that differentiate it from other variants of the virus.</p>
    <p>Sometimes new variants emerge and disappear whereas sometimes, new variants emerge and persist. Changes in the virus are monitored, including changes to the spikes on the surface of the virus.</p>

    <h2>How do virus variants form ?</h2>

    <p>As expected, multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented</p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>B.1.526 - 1st detected in United States (New York) – November 2020</li>
      <li>B.1.526.1 - 1st detected in United States (New York) – October 2020</li>
      <li>B.1.525 - 1st detected in United Kingdom/Nigeria – December 2020</li>
      <li>P.2- 1st detected in Brazil – April 2020</li>
      <li>B.1.617- 1st detected in India – February 2021</li>
      <li>B.1.617.1- 1st detected in India – December 2020</li>
      <li>B.1.617.2- 1st detected in India – December 2020</li>
      <li>B.1.617.3- 1st detected in  India – October 2020</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Recently the WHO released a new nomenclature to simplify the names of the variants of Coronavirus and to discourage the practice of associating them to a particular region or country.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Variant - B.1.1.7  = ALPHA</li>
      <li>Variant - B.1.351 = BETA</li>
      <li>Variant - P.1        = GAMMA</li>
      <li>Variant B.1.617.2 = DELTA</li>
    </ul>
